# Angular Nx Storybook Monorepo

# What is Nx?
The Nx Monorepo Manager is a build and development tool for managing monorepos. A monorepo is a software development strategy where multiple projects or libraries are stored within a single repository. Nx provides a set of powerful features to help developers streamline their work in this environment, including:

1. Code sharing and reuse: Nx enables developers to easily share and reuse code across multiple projects within the monorepo.
1. Dependency management: Nx understands the dependencies between projects, allowing for efficient incremental builds and testing.
1. Consistent tooling: Nx provides a consistent set of tools and configurations for all projects, ensuring that the entire monorepo follows best practices and remains maintainable over time.
1. Extensible plugin system: Nx supports a wide range of plugins for popular frameworks and libraries, making it easy to add new capabilities to the monorepo.
